Complex Machine Learning Model Overview:

This project features a complex machine learning model designed for binary classification tasks. The model leverages a combination of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy and generalization.

Model Architecture Convolutional Layers:

Purpose: Extract spatial features from sequential data.

Configuration: 
* Number of layers: 1 to 6
* Filters: 32 to 128
* Kernel sizes: 3 or 5

Purpose: Capture temporal and sequential dependencies.

Configuration: 
* Number of layers: 2 to 7
* Units per layer: 50 to 150
* Type: LSTM or GRU
* Dropout rate: 0.3 to 0.5

Purpose: Process features and perform final classification.

Configuration:
* Number of layers: 7 to 10
* Units per layer: 64 to 256
* L2 Regularization: 0.01 to 0.1
* Dropout rate: 0.3 to 0.5

Activation: sigmoid for binary classification.

Requirements:
* numpy
* tensorflow
* scikit-learn
* keras-tuner

Setup and clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/TelmoFari/model-complex`

Go to Repository: 

`cd model-complex`

Install Dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The model uses synthetic data generated within the script. You can modify the generate_data function to use real datasets.

Train the Model

Run a model-complex-ia.py script

`python model-complex-ia.py`

Model Evaluation and Saving:

The model is automatically evaluated and saved as model-complex-ia.h5 after training.

Configuration Hyperparameters: 

* Adjust the hyperparameters: directly in the create_model function.
* Training Intervals: The model training loop runs every minute. Modify the time.sleep(60) interval in model-complex-ia.py if needed.
