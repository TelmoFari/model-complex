Complex Machine Learning Model
Overview
This project features a complex machine learning model designed for binary classification tasks. The model leverages a combination of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers to achieve high accuracy and generalization.

Model Architecture
Convolutional Layers

Purpose: Extract spatial features from sequential data.
Configuration:
Number of layers: 1 to 6
Filters: 32 to 128
Kernel sizes: 3 or 5
Each convolutional layer is followed by a MaxPooling1D and BatchNormalization layer.
Recurrent Layers

Purpose: Capture temporal and sequential dependencies.
Configuration:
Number of layers: 2 to 7
Units per layer: 50 to 150
Type: LSTM or GRU
Dropout rate: 0.3 to 0.5
Dense Layers

Purpose: Process features and perform final classification.
Configuration:
Number of layers: 7 to 10
Units per layer: 64 to 256
L2 Regularization: 0.01 to 0.1
Dropout rate: 0.3 to 0.5
Output Layer

Activation: sigmoid for binary classification.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.9 or later
Required Python packages (numpy, tensorflow, scikit-learn, keras-tuner)
Setup
Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/TelmoFari/model-complex
```
```
cd model-complex 
```
Install Dependencies

You can use replit.nix to manage dependencies in Replit. If you prefer a local setup, use pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The model uses synthetic data generated within the script. You can modify the generate_data function to use real datasets.

Train the Model

Run the model-complex-ia.py script to start the training process:
```
python model-complex-ia.py
```
Model Evaluation and Saving

The model is automatically evaluated and saved as model-complex-ia.h5 after training.

Configuration
Hyperparameters: Adjust the hyperparameters directly in the create_model function.
Training Intervals: The model training loop runs every minute. Modify the time.sleep(60) interval in model-complex-ia.py if needed.
